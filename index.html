 <h2>My Favorite Animals</h2>

 <h3>Shark</h3>
 <p>The sark is the oceans feircest predator, they are extremely tough and resilient and there are over a million species around the glbe. They range from plankton eaters to Great whites who are capable of cutting wales in half.They have extremely tough skin and can smell and feel any change in the water chemistry for miles in every direction.  I have loved Sharks since I was a young child and this is why they stand out to me.</p>
